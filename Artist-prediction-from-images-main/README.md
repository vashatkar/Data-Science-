# OBJECTIVE:
Artist identification is traditionally performed by art historians and curators who have expertise and familiarity with different artists and styles of
art. This is a complex and interesting problem for computers because identifying an artist does not just require object or face detection. Artists can paint a
wide variety of objects and scenes, but they have vastly different styles and content. Occasionally many artists from the same time period will have
similar styles, and some artist such as Pablo Picasso have painted in multiple styles and changed their style over time. Artist identification is the task of
identifying the artist of a painting given no other information about it. One of the most comprehensive datasets, WikiArt [1], has around
150,000 artworks by 2,500 artists. A reliable way to identify artist is not only useful for labeling art pieces but also for identifying forgeries. This is an
important requirement for cataloguing art, especially as art is increasingly digitized. Online Art collections are growing with the aim of making all
art easily available and accessible online. As these collections grow, it becomes increasingly important to be able to efficiently label and identify newly
digitized art pieces. In this project we plan to accurately classify art works based on Artists using different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks
