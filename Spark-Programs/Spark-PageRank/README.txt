Execution
---------
All of the build & execution commands are organized in the Makefile.
1) Unzip project file.
2) Open command prompt.
3) Navigate to directory where project files unzipped.
4) Edit the Makefile to customize the environment at the top.
	Sufficient for standalone: hadoop.root, jar.name, local.input

Set "local.k_value" = k (number of vertices in a graph chain as per document)

Set "jar.name" = wc.PageRank

	Other defaults acceptable for running standalone.
5) Standalone Hadoop:
	make switch-standalone		-- set standalone Hadoop environment (execute once)
	make local
6) Pseudo-Distributed Hadoop: (https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html#Pseudo-Distributed_Operation)
	make switch-pseudo			-- set pseudo-clustered Hadoop environment (execute once)
	make pseudo					-- first execution
	make pseudoq				-- later executions since namenode and datanode already running 
7) AWS EMR Hadoop: (you must configure the emr.* config parameters at top of Makefile)
	make upload-input-aws		-- only before first execution
	make aws					-- check for successful execution with web interface (aws.amazon.com)
	download-output-aws			-- after successful execution & termination





Input:
-------------------------
For input, Create "input" directory and place the dataset into that directory for execution
